## GO CLI:
    go build -> compiles "main" package
    go run -> compiles and executes one or two files
    go fmt -> formats all the code in each file
    go install -> compiles and install a pakce.
    go get -> downloads the raw source code of some else's packages
    got test -> Runs any tests associated with the current project

## Package 
    Scope of source code 
    types of package
        - Executable => Generates a file that can run
        - Reusable => Code used as 'helpers' Good place to put resuable logic

## OOP in GO
    In go it extend a base type and add some extra functionality to it (behavior of type)
    Ex type deck []string -> functions with deck as a 'recevier'


## Note
    Array can mutable
